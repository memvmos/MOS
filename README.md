# 🧠 Symbolic OS – Recursive Causal Grid with AI Agent

Welcome to **Symbolic OS**, a visual and programmable operating system powered by symbolic reasoning, recursive memory, and a layered logic structure based on your custom `Quadrabase`.

## 🚀 Live Features

- 🔁 **Causal Grid** UI representing symbolic arithmetic (e.g., `2 + 3 = 5 → ∵`)
- 🤖 **AI Chat Agent** with symbolic reply logic
- 📜 **Visible Symbolic Chat Thread** showing conversation history
- 🧠 `.symchat.json` simulated memory log (symbolic, geometric, and emotional)
- 📦 **Download ZIP** directly from the UI
- 🔗 Homepage link to: [https://fr3raction.super.site](https://fr3raction.super.site)
